# SQLite & R for Data Science

A few interesting databases, along with graphs made with the data using R

1.  Lemurs/Lemurs.sqlite: 44 Main Species of Lemur

2.  NASA Astronauts/Astronauts.sqlite: List of all NASA Astronauts.

3.  Dinosaurs/Dinosaurs.sqlite: List of Dinosaurs; perhaps somewhat incomplete, so inferences are a bit off.

4.  Programming Languages/Programming Languages.sqlite: List of all programming languages.
